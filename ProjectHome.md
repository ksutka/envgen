OCSEGen is used to close open components and systems with its execution context (environment), generated based on assumptions specified by a user or extracted from the code. OCSEGen can be used as a front end for analysis techniques such as testing, model checking and symbolic execution, which may require the system under test to be closed with its environment first. OCSEGen can be used as

  * **Enabling** technique in cases when an open system needs to be closed first, before the back end analysis can be run.

  * **Performance-enhancing** technique in cases when the closed system under test is too large for the back end analysis and needs to be broken into smaller open modules first.
